1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

        No, I would not use a unit test to test the message feature of message application since the "message" feature consists of multiple parts and we want to make small tests that test each part individually.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

        Yes, because we can make a rule such as no more than 80 characters and create tests for that and see if it behaves the way that it should such as a message with 81 characters is blocked.
